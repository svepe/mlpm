### Interesting papers

## Coursework

You can find the MLPM coursework [here](https://github.com/svepe/mlpm/blob/master/coursework/mlpm_coursework.pdf).

**Due date**: 10 Dec 2019

You should hand in a hard copy report at one of the lectures before the deadline.
Preferably you would write your report in English on a computer using e.g. LaTeX.
This is a great opportunity to practice your technical English as well as to
learn useful tools such as LaTeX. Handwritten reports in Bulgarian are acceptable,
but not encouraged.

There are no hard requirements for the programming language, however, you are
strongly advised to use Python since this is the predominantly used language
in the field.
